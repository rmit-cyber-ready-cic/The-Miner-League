**Problem Statement:**
	How could we reduce academic staff email flows from students with common and often repeated concerns, using AI and VA type tools embedded in University systems
 


**Solution:**
	AI powered  chatbot was developed to assist students to improve their learning experience and also as a virtual assistant for the staff members to reduce their workload. Powered by data analytics and AI, a chatbotgrants  an  immediate  access  to  the  information  needed  anytime  and  anywhere  which  encourages students with active learning. This solution is also aimed to reduce the overwhelming amount of email received  by  the  staff  and  the  tedious  amount  of  time  spent  on replying. Students get 24/7 automated  guidance for e-forms, deadline extensions, technical queries, assignment clarifications and other course relatedproblems and more. The Integrated Virtual Assistant project aims to develop a personalized communication solution to improve communication efficiency, transform the student experience, and enhance student wellbeing.
